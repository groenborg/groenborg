## Simon is the name 👋

Noticeably you are on the website quite possibly containing the largest amount of open-source code in the world, so it might not come as a surprise that I am a software developer, probably just like you. If you are not a developer, then how did you ever get here? Did you take the AWS Route 53 and a shortcut under the SSH Tunnel to get here?

I am a product designer, business developer and software generalist. I am the other 50% of inc inc, currently building an organization of startups and entrepreneurship.

Thank you for reading me!
## 3 things about me 👋

- ⚡️ Tech environmentalist
- ⚡️ inc inc partner
- ⚡️ Former CTO of FeedHive.io
