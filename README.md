### Read me! 👋

Hi There. This is Simon's README.md file speaking!. Noticably you are on a website containing probaly the largest amout of opensource code in the world, so it might not come as a surprise that this guy is a programmer, just like you. (If you are not programmer, then how did you ever get here?!). Did you take the AWS Route 53 and under the SSH Tunnel to get here. 
Anyhow, this particular programmer specimen we are dealing with is a Full-stack Developer. Believeable he loves coding, try to take his computer away from him whilst coding and you will see quite the reaction. He loves climbing, Diving and open source, though he might not be the biggest contributor, yet. He truly appriciate the strong and help community facilitated by all the skilled and passionated people within this business. Automation, PWA, JAMStacks, GraphQL, Rest services, data modelleing, Infrastrucutre as Code, Kubernetes, application archirecture, project management etc. are but a few of this fine coders skills. 

Thank you Readme! I beleive a person greeting is in order as well.
